        <h2>About Kangaroos</h2>
        <p>Kangaroos are marsupials native to Australia. They are known for their powerful legs and their ability to hop at high speeds. There are four species of kangaroo: the red kangaroo, eastern grey kangaroo, western grey kangaroo, and the antilopine kangaroo. Kangaroos have a unique reproductive system, with females giving birth to underdeveloped young called joeys, which they nurture in their marsupium (pouch) until they are fully developed.</p>
