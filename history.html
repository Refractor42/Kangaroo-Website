        <h2>Kangaroo History</h2>
        <p>Kangaroos have a long and fascinating history. They have been a part of Australian culture for thousands of years, with indigenous Australians having a deep spiritual connection to these animals. Kangaroos were first encountered by European settlers in the late 18th century, and have since become a national symbol of Australia.</p>
        <p>Kangaroos have had a tumultuous relationship with humans. They were once hunted for their meat and skins, but are now protected under Australian law. In recent years, there have been efforts to relocate kangaroos from urban areas to more natural habitats to reduce the conflict between humans and kangaroos.</p>
