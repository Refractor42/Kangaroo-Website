        <h2>More About Kangaroos</h2>
        <p>Kangaroos are herbivores and are known for their powerful legs and tail, which they use for hopping at high speeds and balancing while jumping. They are native to Australia and can be found in a variety of habitats, including grasslands, forests, and deserts. Adult kangaroos can reach up to 6 feet tall and can hop up to 40 mph.</p>
        <p>In addition to their physical abilities, kangaroos are also known for their unique reproductive system. Female kangaroos have a marsupium (pouch) in which they nurture their young, called joeys, until they are fully developed. After giving birth, female kangaroos can become pregnant again almost immediately, and their joeys can continue to nurse while they are carrying a new embryo. This allows kangaroos to raise multiple offspring at different stages of development at the same time.</p>
